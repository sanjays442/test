  With recovery at the forefront, we aim to provide a free service to anyone looking to improve their life and enjoy a future free of addiction. With the nature of the internet and big rehab centers ability to spend big, some of the best treatment programs never make it in front of the masses as an option. They are simply swallowed up by the massive marketing budgets of the industry giants. After seeing this happen and watching great programs fail, we founded Addiction Network. The aim is to allow an even playing field allowing the client to choose the best treatment center rather than forcing large treatment centers on the public through savvy marketing and big ad budgets.
