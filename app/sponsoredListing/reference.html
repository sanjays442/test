									<label>Wilderness Camp Addiction Treatment</label>

								</h1>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>Wilderness camps provide a lot of benefits for both adolescents seeking treatment, and their parents.&nbsp; Some of those benefits include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structure.&nbsp; Wilderness camps are set up with very strict structure.&nbsp; Often a structure that is lacking at home.&nbsp; This allows younger clients to learn a way of life without drugs and alcohol.&nbsp; It also provides parents with
            guidelines for implimenting structure when their adolescent returns home.</li>
          <li>Adventure. While wilderness camps can be challenging to teens, they also provide a great sense of adventure during the recovery process.</li>
          <li>Beautiful setting. Most wilderness camps are located in the forest or in the mountains giving clients a great natural environment to begin their journey to recovery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wilderness camps are a great option for troubled teens and often young adults alike.&nbsp;</p>
